##Project Question##

**What is the question you hope to answer**

Are there certain *team* criteria e.g. offensive/defensive oriented / pace of play that make a team more likely to win the NBA championship?  Alternatively, can we predict which team will win the NBA championship based off of a set of team characteristics?

**Corollary questions**

Are historical NBA championship teams more skewed towards certain team dynamics vs. others e.g. do they play with a slow/fast pace compared with other teams/are they more offensive or defensive?

Can we segment NBA championship teams into categories i.e. are there multiple formulas for success when setting the strategy for gameplay?

Can we build a model that will take a certain input e.g. the first half of current season NBA team statistics that will accurately predict the NBA champion?

**What data are you planning to use to answer that question?**

I will use the Team Season statistics from Basketball Reference.  This includes criteria on game outcomes (Win or Loss), team totals for basic stats (points, rebounds, assists, etc.), per game stats (FG/G, Points/G, etc.), opponent stats (both points, and per game), and advanced stats (Pace, ORTG, DRTG).
As there are close to 100 different stats, I will do some exploratory analysis to see which team stats to focus on and use as inputs for the model.

**Why did you choose this topic?**
I have a natural interest in basketball and sports analytics. Much of the discussion and analysis I have seen on what makes an NBA championship team is focused on individual player statistics and the number of 'superstar' players a team has.  I believe that the team gameplay as equally if not more important than the individual player contributions and want to explore if I can find some interesting insights from using data science techniques.  As I am genuinely interested in this topic, it will be a great project for me to get familar with using data science techniques.
